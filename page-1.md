### 1. Morrison v. Peach&#x20;

On January 1, Edward Schmidt received a new myPhone 15, manufactured by Peach Inc., which he ordered directly from Peach's website. When he left for work on January 3, 2020, his phone was still in the same condition that it was when it left the factory, and he had not yet downloaded any third-party apps yet. Schmidt was driving east on Interstate 94 near Madison, Wisconsin when he realized that he would be late for work due to traffic congestion. Schmidt decided to tell his boss about being late, so he opened the phone's messaging app to text his boss. While he was sending the message, he drifted and hit the car in the lane next to him. The other vehicle crashed into a steel guardrail, which caused a three-foot portion of the rail to break off and fly through the windshield of a another car traveling west on the highway. The westbound car was occupied by Clare, Sean, Quinn, and Riley Morrison, all of whom sustained severe injuries. Riley, six years old, subsequently died at the hospital.&#x20;

The myPhone 15 did not display a warning about the dangers of operating a vehicle while using the device when opening the messaging app. For several years, there has been publicly available data about the dangers of using mobile devices while driving. Also, prior to 2020, a few researchers indicated that mobile device users tend to develop a neurobiological compulsion to engage in texting behavior (both sending messages and checking recently received messages).&#x20;

Ten years before myPhone 15 was released, Peach obtained a patent for a “lock-out” mechanism. The patent's description states, "The lock-out mechanism disables the ability of a handheld computing device to perform certain functions, such as texting, while one is driving." However, Peach has never installed the lock-out mechanism into its devices.

During some preliminary investigation, the Morrisons learned that Schmidt was driving without liability insurance and was unemployed. He had only $200 dollars in the bank and about $40,000 in credit card debt. Even if the Morrisons sued Schmidt and obtained a judgment against him, it is unlikely that they would ever be able to collect the money. So, the Morrisons proceeded to sue Peach for negligence and strict product liability.

The Morrisons' suit against Peach alleges that Peach should be liable for (1) negligence based on the lack of a warning about texting-and-driving while the messaging app opens, and (2) strict product liability for not installing the lock-out software on the myPhone 15.

Respond to the following prompts:

1. Should Peach be liable for **negligence for** **failing to have a warning about the dangers of texting-and-driving** while the messaging app opens? Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of negligent failure to warn, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).
2. Should Peach be liable based on **strict product liability for not installing the lock-out software.** Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of negligence, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).

### 2. Tide PODS (no, not eating them this time)

In September 2014, Swartz lived with her parents. She used her parents' washing machine, dryer, and laundry detergent to do her laundry.&#x20;

Before leaving for work one day, Swartz decided to do a load of laundry. Instead of using liquid or powder laundry detergent to wash her clothes, Swartz used a Tide POD. A POD contains concentrated detergent in a dissolvable packet. Swartz obtained the POD from a package of PODs that her mother had purchased from a local retail store.&#x20;

After Swartz “pulled the Tide POD out of the package,” it “just popped,” partially exploding in her hand. About one-half of the concentrated detergent in the POD splattered on her shirt, her neck, and her hands.

Following the explosion, Swartz immediately washed her hands and wiped the moisture from the POD off her face, neck, and other parts of her body that she believed came into contact with the detergent. She also changed her shirt, which “had a wet stain on it because of the Tide POD.” But Swartz did not change her bra. She left her bra in place because, at that time, she “didn’t think that the bra got any moisture from the POD on it.” She then put the remaining one-half of the exploded POD into the washing machine, started her load of laundry, and left for work.

The Tide POD packaging includes a label instructing that user that if skin or clothing is exposed to the contents of the POD, the user should remove the contaminated clothing and rinse the skin with water. However, the packaging did not provide a warning or precautions about the product’s susceptibility of rupturing, the ability to cause burns, or precautions to take to avoid chemical burns. In her deposition, her testified that if the warnings existed, she “would have had the ability to understand the dangers posed by the product.”

About two hours later, Swartz began to experience “extreme discomfort” on her left breast. Swartz says that she felt an “itching, a nagging itching, like the worst mosquito bite ever.” Swartz then discovered that some of her skin on her breast had “peeled off and stuck to the inner side of her bra.” Swartz realized that the concentrated detergent from the POD had seeped through her shirt onto her bra, and she concluded that the detergent on her bra came into contact with her breast and caused a chemical burn.

Swartz filed suit against Procter and Gamble (manufacturer of the Tide PODS) for negligent failure to warn and strict product liability for defective design.

1. **Failure-to-warn claim:** Swartz argues that P\&G failed to warn her that the PODs could explode when removed from their packaging, and that P\&G failed to warn her that the chemicals that comprise the PODs could cause chemical burns to the skin.&#x20;

Should P\&G be liable for negligent failure-to-warn? Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of negligent failure to warn, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).

2. **Defective design claim:** Swartz argues that the design of the PODs caused the film on the PODs to weaken over time when exposed to water and moisture, resulting in a compromised shelf life of the product. To support this claim, an expert testified that P\&G "did not adequately test the safety" of the PODs; that "P\&G knew of the hazardous nature of the POD ingredients"; that "the film covering the POD could rupture"; and that "P\&G's cautionary wording on the POD packaging was inadequate."

Should Peach be liable for defective design (based on strict product liability)? Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of a defective design claim in strict product liability, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).

### 3. Oh, Rats!

A pest control company, which serviced the boys club, placed the poison in an unmarked container and put it in a cabinet. A 9-year old boy found the poison, ingested it, and died. Parents sued the boys club, the pest control company, and the manufacturer (ICI) for negligence and strict product liability for defective design and negligent failure to warn.

The poison was designed and manufactured by a company called ICI Americas. The rat poison that the boy ingested was called Talon-G. Talon-G was packaged in a container with EPA-approved labeling, which displayed warnings that:

* it should be kept out of reach of children;
* it may be harmful or fatal if swallowed; and
* &#x20;that it be stored in its original container in a location inaccessible to children.

The poison did not contain any ingredients that tasted bitter or induced vomiting in humans.

At this point, an additive called Bitrex had been on the market for a decade or more; it tasted bitter and repulsive to people, but not to rats. ICI sold Talon-G only to professional pest control operators.

1. **Defective design claim:** Should ICI be liable for defective design (based on strict product liability)? Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of a defective design claim in strict product liability, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).
2. **Failure-to-warn claim:** Should ICI be liable for negligent failure-to-warn? Fully explain your rationale (i.e., address each of the elements of negligent failure to warn, which facts are relevant to those elements, and why those facts are relevant to those elements).
